    <h2>Side Quests</h2>
    <p>Outside of studying, I try to keep myself busy by doing something<sup>TM</sup>. Here's some stuff I'm working on!</p>
    <h3>Quizbowl / Academic Team</h3>
    <h4>Question Writing</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2024, I and a couple other seniors from Kentucky who fancied playing "Academic Team" (Kentucky's version of quizbowl/scholarbowl)
        started the first iteration of our own Academic Team-esque question set known as SKATABowl. In the summmer of 2025, we began working on the second edition, coined 2KATABowl. We're out of luck for the third edition name, but surely the potential fourth and fifth set will be fine. You can find a link to them below: <em>(I'll do this later when I build the SKATA writing team website!)</em></p>
    <p>I've also began writing for a quizbowl housewrite, known as MACKEREL, and I will potentially join the Scottie, Kentucky's premier quizbowl housewrite.</p>
    <h4>Buzzer System</h4>
    <p><em>Stay tuned!</em></p>
    <h4>Scorekeeping</h4>
    Also in the summer in 2024, I began obsessively working on a scoresheet to be used for KAAC style Academic Team. In the future, I plan on making this a website (on github) that'll be much more intuitive and useful!
